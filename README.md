# Pyrlandia Travel Site
## Description
The purpose of this site is to provide prospective tourists and visitors the main highlights of our wonderful country. And to convince them to come here rather than to any other mythical realm to which they might be considering (including Trollheim!!!).   
- I wanted to create this website which combines two of my passions: Travel and Fantasy.
- I built this website in order to showcase what I have learned so far through my level 5 diploma in Coding using Javascript along with HTML and CSS.
- Troughout this project so far I have grown in confidence and feel like I can easily build a website from scratch, and also make it interactive for the user, something  I previously did not feel capable to do.
- From studying the course material and other resources on the web, I have learned lots of different ways to get the ideas from my head to the code of my wensite. It's been a thrilling ride!
 
## UX design

I wanted to make the user experience as easy to use but at the same time making the website unique and interesting to use. 


## Bugs and Testing



## Deployment
My site was deployed on github pages at https://melissabuckingham.github.io/Pyrlandia/


## Credits
I used the Love Running project for inspiration including for the hero image inclusion and the responsiveness on smaler screened devices.
I drew inspiration from geeksforgeeks.org and sitepoint.com, for the quiz section of the website.
